  <description>Regular expression naming plugin directory names to
  include.  Any plugin not matching this expression is excluded.
  In any case you need at least include the nutch-extensionpoints plugin. By
  default Nutch includes crawling just HTML and plain text via HTTP,
  and basic indexing and search plugins. In order to use HTTPS please enable 
  protocol-httpclient, but be aware of possible intermittent problems with the 
  underlying commons-httpclient library. Nutch now also includes integration with Tika
  to leverage Tika's parsing capabilities for multiple content types. The existing Nutch
  parser implementations will likely be phased out in the next release or so, as such, it is
  a good idea to begin migrating away from anything not provided by parse-tika.
